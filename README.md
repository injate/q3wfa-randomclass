# q3-wfa randomclass

There are 2 steps too start using this class randomizer:

1) Add `exec randomclass.cfg` to your autoexec config or any other constantly ran config in your WFA cfgs.
2) Execute randomclass program and leave it running while you're playing

To disable comment out undo or comment out step 1.

How it works: whenever 'exec randomclass.cfg' is ran it access the file and this program detects that. You can manually simulate this by just opening randomclass.cfg and it should randomize your class again.
